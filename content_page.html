        <h4>1. Make Your Passwords Very Long</h4>
        <p>
          Your enemy isn’t some guy in a ski mask trying to guess your password one try at a time. It’s a program that automatically runs through massive databases of common passwords or random combinations of characters.
          The best answer to that is a very long string of words. As the webcomic xkcd famously pointed out, a bunch of plain words is pretty good.
          But as many hackers use “dictionary attacks” to guess regular words, it’s best to add some capital letters, special characters, or numbers.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Don't Use a Common Phrase</h4>
        <p>
          But don’t use the same bunch of plain words as everyone else. If your password consisted of the entire script of Hamlet, it would still be unsafe if everyone else had the same password. “When in the course of human events” is a crappy password. So is a famous movie line, or a Bible verse, or even an acronym of a Bible verse.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Don't Reuse Passwords</h4>
        <p>
          When your password on some web service gets hacked (and it will), you’d better hope you didn’t use the same password on three other services. Don’t use a weak password for services that “don’t matter,” because some day you might give one of those services your credit card info, or use it to authorize more important services, and you won’t think to beef up your password.
        </p>
        <h4>4. Use a Password Manager</h4>
        <p>
          Get your computer to make and remember your passwords for you. This is the only reliable but convenient way to manage the vast quantity of passwords that modern life requires.
          All these apps will create and remember your passwords. And all of them tell you how secure each of your passwords are. Some even alert you when the services you use get hacked, whether or not you were personally exposed.
        </p>
        <h4>5. Use two-factor authentication</h4>
        <p>
          While it isn’t foolproof, two-factor provides a layer of security for only a minimal loss of convenience. But not all two-factor is equally secure. Dedicated authentication apps are a lot safer than just getting a code over SMS. But both are safer than a password alone.
