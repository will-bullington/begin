  <h1>Weakness</h1>

<p>
    Security Smart is an informational website that attempts to better prortect
    people by informing them of the current tactics that people use to hack
    passwords.
</p>

<p>
    There are two main weakness that afflict peoples passwords are lazyness and
    and password sharing. If you want a secure password you first hace to make it
    long. Any password no matter how many types of numbers, letters, or symbols you have
    it must be long. The length of the password is most iportant. Most people that
    try to steal passwords use a wordlist, or a very long list of different combinations
    of letters and symbols and numbers saved as a regular text file. These lists can
    contain from around 15,000 to 2,000,000 bytes. However, most of the time these
    lists contain "words" or strings of keyboard symbols that are around 1-10 charecters
    therefore, you should create passwords that are longer than 10 charecters.
</p>
<h2>Perspective</h2>

    <p>If your password is three chrecters of the same type, such as "123"
    it would take 25 nanoseconds to crack it using only broot force tactics.</p>

    <p>If it was 3 charecters with two different types such as "1w3", it would take
    1 Microsecond to broot force.</p>

    <p>However if it were 10 charecters of the same type such as "alkjgtrevb" it would take
    an hour.</p>

     <p>Using 10 charecters with different symbols such as, "tylkdi4567", it would take the
     same amount of time.</p>

     <p>Therefore it is more important to keep your passwords long, rather than
     just diverse, however both is best.</p>

     <p>For example, if I set a password such as,
     klaytontucker071596, using just broot force it would take <em> 294 billion years to
     crack.</em></p>
