      <h2>How to Make a Good Password</h2>

      <h3>Our comprehensive guide to staying protected on the web</h3>

      <h4>1. Make Your Passwords Very Long</h4>

      <p>
    
 	   Your enemy isn’t some guy in a ski mask trying to guess your password one try at a time. It’s a program that automatically runs through massive databases of common passwords or random combinations of characters.
        The best answer to that is a very long string of words. As the webcomic xkcd famously pointed out, a bunch of plain words is pretty good.
        But as many hackers use “dictionary attacks” to guess regular words, it’s best to add some capital letters, special characters, or numbers.

   <h4>2. Don't Use a Common Phrase</h4>

      <p>
        But don’t use the same bunch of plain words as everyone else. If your password consisted of the entire script of Hamlet, it would still be unsafe if everyone else had the same password. “When in the course of human events” is a crappy password. So is a famous movie line, or a Bible verse, or even an acronym of a Bible verse.
